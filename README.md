# building-a-JS-library


## Description
This is a library built as a part of follwing along my Udemy course on understanding the wierd bits of Javascript. Possibly better described as as a deeper dive into the language which included the hands on building of a library to better understand the concepts being taught. That is what objects are, all the things that are actually objects, prototypes, operators are fuctions, and so on. All those things that are not really explained in the typical Javascript course but are the things that make the language what it is. That understanding is further solidified with the building of this library.

## Usage
In its current form there is no serious utility for this library. Is simply a proof of understanding of the concepts taught in the course. However, it is a good starting point for a library that
could be used as a way to extend the functionality of the javascript and the jquery libraries.
